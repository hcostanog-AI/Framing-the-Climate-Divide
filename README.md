# Framing-the-Climate-Divide
Investigation of the discursive power dynamics in the negotiations around global climate by analyzing presidential speeches and stakeholders speeches from the COP15 Copenhagen summit in 2009. Utilizing the advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique of BERTopic.

This clash of discursive frames underscores the core research problem addressed in this thesis: the imbalance in agenda-setting power in climate negotiations. The ability of Global North actors to dominate discourse and frame “the problem” and its “solutions” in technocratic terms has profound consequences. It marginalizes alternative perspectives rooted in justice, reinforces existing power asymmetries, and limits the scope of possible agreements. Understanding how these competing frames manifest in key moments of international climate diplomacy, such as COP15, is therefore critical for unpacking the broader political economy of climate governance (Ülgen, 2021).

This thesis investigates how discursive power asymmetries between the Global North and the Global South manifest in climate negotiations, focusing on the Copenhagen Climate Summit (COP15). Studing  how language itself functions as a site of political struggle. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) provide a unique methodological opportunity to systematically analyze large corpora of political speeches, thereby revealing patterns of framing, emphasis, and omission that shape global climate governance (Ojadi, J. O., Onukwulu, E. C., Odionu, C. S., & Owulade, O. A. (2023); Adekoya, R., Akinfaderin, A.,2025).
The central research question guiding this study is:
What differences in thematic focus, identified through NLP topic modeling, indicate Global North actors’ agenda-setting power in framing COP15 climate negotiations primarily around technocratic solutions, compared to Global South leaders’ emphasis on historical responsibility and equity?

Why BERTopic is Superior for This Study
This methodological innovation makes BERTopic particularly well suited for analyzing political discourse at COP15. The speeches delivered by heads of state are relatively short, rhetorically dense, and often employ varied linguistic formulations for similar ideas (e.g., “historical responsibility” vs. “climate debt”). By leveraging contextual embeddings, BERTopic captures these subtleties far better than LDA or other earlier models.
Moreover, BERTopic’s flexibility allows the study to retain small but politically significant topics, such as mentions of “loss and damage” or “technology transfer,” which might otherwise be drowned out by larger themes in probabilistic models. In doing so, the method strengthens the ability to empirically trace how Global North and Global South leaders articulated competing frames of technocracy versus justice, thereby aligning the computational method with the theoretical concerns of discourse, power, and agenda-setting.
